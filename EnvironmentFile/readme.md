# Setting

Variable settings will be read while SDCopy starting. Values can be set in these ways:

1. Environment file named as SDCopy.env, placed in /boot/firmware/. The folder is the default mapping point of the boot partition of Ubuntu Arm64 20.04. Use [this systemd](../SystemdFile/Ubuntu%20Arm64%2020.04/SDCopy.service) file.
2. Environment file named as SDCopy.env, placed in /boot/. The folder is the default mapping point of the boot partition of PiOS Arm32 10. Use [this systemd](../SystemdFile/PiOS%20Arm32%2010/SDCopy.service) file.
3. Environment file named as SDCopy.env, placed in /etc/. Use [this systemd](../SystemdFile/etc/SDCopy.service) file.

For the convenience of end users to edit, 1 and 2 are recommended for pre-made images. 3 is a good way for advanced user who install the app manually.
